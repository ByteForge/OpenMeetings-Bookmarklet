OpenMeetings Bookmarklet
========================

***Toggles surrounding elements of the OpenMeetings Flash interface***
For moodle 2.4 Online Conferences.

Intent
------

During **Online Conferences** the size of the **OpenMeetings Flash interface** can be to small, even to a point where it's usability is questionable.

This [bookmarklet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet) toggles ( turn on / off ) the **OpenMeetings Flash interface** to stretch out in the whole browser or shrink back to it's original size.

**The bookmarklet should not interfere and / or alter the behaviour of the OpenMeetings Flash interface. More information in the LICENSE.txt**

For safety and other reasons the bookmarklet works **ONLY** during **Online Conferences** at "technikum-wien.at" and **WILL NOT** alter other sites.
